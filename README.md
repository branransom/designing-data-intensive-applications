# Designing Data Intensive Applications

I started reading the book Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann a while back, and found it to be very dense with a lot of great information. I never made it all the way through, and wish I had taken notes in my original pass through. I'm restarting the book, and taking notes as I go along to help capture important bits and pieces. This repository contains those notes.
